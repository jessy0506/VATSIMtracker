Changes from 1.0.0 to 1.0.1:
*Changes*
-Aircraft icons on the map are now actually depicting an aircraft icon, rather than a square
-Removed the time column from the 'All flights' list since I found it rather useless




*Fixes*
-Fixed some airport controllers not being shown in the active controllers table
-Fixed white screen when an airport has an ATIS, but no text inside it




*Newly added*
-Added the ability to click on a callsign to focus the map on that flight
-Added a background to the website
-Added "Is jessy flying?" section showing if I'm online and doing a flight. Feel free to track me!







This is a small VATSIM flight tracker I made. May contain bugs or issues.
I'll be active on Github alot! If you have any feature requests or suggestions, let me know via an issue here on Github, or contact me on discord: diemalsejesbes

Features:

Airport Filter

-Fetch latest metar

-Filter traffic for that airport

-Shows online VATSIM ATC, with an ATIS if available

-Live Flight map displaying all the departures/arrivals for that airport

-Pretty advanced filtering system

--Filter for all flights with the same callsign and display them in a list and on a map

--Filter for all flights with the same aicraft type and display them in a list and on a map. Partial aircraft ICAO codes will also work ('B73' to display all variants of the Boeing 737 for example)

--Applying the above filters to airport specific traffic for even more precise filtering

-The ability to sort by arrivals and departures

-Sorting by earliest arrival ETA and latest arrival ETA by pressing "arrival time". Times are all in UTC.


Many more features to come! Let me know if you have any suggestions.



I'm still new to web developing, go easy on me :')
